# Known Issues

## No Persistent Save:
The games native save functions do not work with bizhawk and partyplanner. Savestating is the method of saving, and options have been given to players to make the game not rely on persistent saving 

## Chance Time game Freeze:
Theres a chance that entering chance time multiple times in a run causes a game freeze due to the character swapping.
Currently looking into a fix, but it is advised to savestate regularly before dice rolls (both for you and the com) in case of a freeze

## Turn 1 Check(maybe fixed):
Theres a chance that "1st place on turn 1" does not send on the first run on the board for that seed. It will send on the second run, and only further ongoing testing will tell if my fix is 100%
